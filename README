NAME
    Module::Install::RTx - RT extension installer

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.21 of Module::Install::RTx, released
    December 7, 2007.

SYNOPSIS
    In the Makefile.PL of the "RTx-Foo" module:

        use inc::Module::Install;

        RTx('Foo');
        author('Your Name <your@email.com>');
        license('perl');

        &WriteAll;

DESCRIPTION
    This Module::Install extension implements one function, "RTx", that
    takes the extension name as the only argument.

    It arranges for certain subdirectories to install into the installed RT
    location, but does not affect the usual "lib" and "t" directories.

    The directory mapping table is as below:

        ./bin   => $RT::LocalPath/bin
        ./etc   => $RT::LocalPath/etc/$NAME
        ./html  => $RT::MasonComponentRoot
        ./po    => $RT::LocalLexiconPath/$NAME
        ./sbin  => $RT::LocalPath/sbin
        ./var   => $RT::VarPath/$NAME

    Under the default RT3 layout in /opt and with the extension name "Foo",
    it becomes:

        ./bin   => /opt/rt3/local/bin
        ./etc   => /opt/rt3/local/etc/Foo
        ./html  => /opt/rt3/share/html
        ./po    => /opt/rt3/local/po/Foo
        ./sbin  => /opt/rt3/local/sbin
        ./var   => /opt/rt3/var/Foo

    By default, all these subdirectories will be installed with "make
    install". you can override this by setting the "WITH_SUBDIRS"
    environment variable to a comma-delimited subdirectory list, such as
    "html,sbin".

    Alternatively, you can also specify the list as a command-line option to
    "Makefile.PL", like this:

        perl Makefile.PL WITH_SUBDIRS=sbin

ENVIRONMENT
    RTHOME
        Path to the RT installation that contains a valid lib/RT.pm.
